## András Dániel Tóth react-native take home test
This repository was created as part of a take home test of a company (not to spoil this task for other candidates I omitted
the name of the company).

### Setup
0. (Have a working developer environment for react-native)
1. Clone the repository
2. Run `npm i` to install dependencies
3. Run `npm run android` to open the app

### Notes on overtime
I felt that the 3-hour timeframe for this task was very constraining. It did not help to realize that I had not installed
previously on my machine adequate working environment (I had a heart attack when the download estimation of **Android Studio** 
started to increase over 45 minutes).

That said it is up to the reviewer to accept or not the work I have done after the time frame. Click on the link above to
access the extra work done.

### Notes on _not_ using a date-time library
While it was compelling to use a date-time library, I decided to avoid using one and focused on vanilla JS solutions.
My reasoning was the short time-frame: it is very easy to get lost in a long documentation and waste time on finding the
right function.

In a real-world setting I would prefer to use well-established APIs of a known library (like Luxon).

### Summary
Thanks for the opportunity and please reach out to me if you have any questions!
